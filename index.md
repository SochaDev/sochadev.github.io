      <p>Sometimes you just have more work than you can handle. Sometimes a great
      contract comes along, but you're not sure if it warrants bringing on a new
      full-time developer. Socha Dev has you covered.</p>

      <p>Projects go off the rails. The freelancer or new developer you hired isn't
      working out, the project is due in two weeks, and it doesn't work. We will
      assess your situation and make it happen.</p>

      <p>Making great projects happen can be a tricky business. Some projects are
      a slam dunk. Some require careful thinking and experienced engineering. Some
      projects have annoying bugs in them. Socha Dev will figure it out.</p>
