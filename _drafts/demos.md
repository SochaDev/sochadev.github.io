As a dedicated dev shop, we often create proofs-of-concept and demo projects to 
illustrate ideas to partners and colleagues. Sometimes those ideas become part 
of an active project, sometimes they're shelved for future use. In either case, 
the exercises are valuable for staying current with the latest dev trends and 
techniques. We've collected some of those here.
