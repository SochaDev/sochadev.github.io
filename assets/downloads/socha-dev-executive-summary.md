## Executive Summary

Socha Dev is a white-label web and app development shop built to help your team
succeed. We specialize in overflow, triage and problem solving services. We work
in the development phase of projects \-- you give us your strategy, designs,
requirements, API docs and any other pertinents \-- we turn it all in to a fully
functioning application.

## History & Successes

Socha Dev was born in early 2011 when principal Jason Socha realized that the
development community needed a reliable, expert A-Team to turn to in times of
need. We\'ve worked with some of the best & brightest dev teams in the nation to
help plan and execute successful projects, be they web sites, web applications,
APIs, or other. A lot of these systems have been heavy on Drupal for the past
few years and many of our staff have attained high levels of Drupal expertise.

A few happy clients include The Chronicle of Higher Education, Discovery
Communications, RepEquity, Interactive Strategies, IWS, and Seabourne. There
are more, but as a white-label dev shop, it\'s sometimes against the rules to
tell you about them!
