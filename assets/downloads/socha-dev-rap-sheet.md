## Executive Summary

Socha Dev is a white-label web and app development shop built to help your team
succeed. We specialize in overflow, triage and problem solving services. We
invite you to check out our past projects, learn more about our team and their
tools — then contact us to discuss your next project.

We work in the development phase of projects — you give us your strategy,
designs, requirements, API docs and any other pertinents — we turn it all in
to a fully functioning application.

Socha Dev was born in early 2011 when principal Jason Socha realized that the
development community needed a reliable, expert A-Team to turn to in times of
need. We've worked with some of the best & brightest dev teams in the nation to
help plan and execute successful projects, be they web sites, web applications,
APIs, or other. A lot of these systems have been heavy on Drupal for the past
few years and many of our staff have attained high levels of Drupal expertise.

A few happy clients include The Chronicle of Higher Education, Discovery
Communications, RepEquity, Interactive Strategies, IWS, and Seabourne. There
are more, but as a white-label dev shop, it's sometimes against the rules to
tell you about them! Check out our teams' bios below for a few more examples of
the trenches we've been in.
