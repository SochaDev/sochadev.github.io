heroContent: <p>As a dedicated dev shop, we often create proofs-of-concept 
  and demo projects to illustrate ideas to partners and colleagues. Sometimes those  
  become part of an active project, sometimes they're shelved for future use. 
  Have a look around.</p>

In all cases, the exercises are valuable for staying current with the latest trends and techniques in this ever-changing dev world of ours &mdash; in many ways, creating these proofs-of-concept are a big part of our jobs.
