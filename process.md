We made this awesome comic to illustrate how we are typically brought on to a
project, how we interact with your team during development, and how that project
becomes an all-around success. We proudly present...

1. _Our sensational saga begins at the weekly Steering Committee meeting, nestled somewhere in the dark gloom of Conference Room 2..._{: .narrator }
1. {{ actor1 }} We ABSOLUTELY MUST complete the {{ project }} project by March!!
  It is critical that our stakeholders have their bubbles!!
  * {{ actor2 }} Yeah, I'm gonna have to look at scheduling with the team ...let's
  meet again next week?
    _...sheeeit, there's no way we can complete the {{ project }} in 2 months!!
    What is she thinking, especially with this hiring freeze?!_{: .purple }
1.  {{ actor3 }} Is she serious, Harv?? _I'm freaking out right now._{: .purple }
Like, seriously ...the {{ project }} is a massively complex system! I know we
can't hire anybody new right now, but I did meet this awesome dev crew called
"`{{ site.title }}`" at a meetup last week...
1. {{ actor2 }} _beep boop [phone](tel:{{ site.contact.phone }}){: .blue } or
  beep boop [contact form](/#contact){: .blue } beep boop_{: .purple }
  Hi, I'm hoping to talk to someone smart about our current needs on the
  {{ project }} system ...we're in deep poo right now. {{ actor3 }}{: .no-img } recommended
  I talk to you.
  * {{ actor4 }} Great, pleasure to meet you Harvey! We are all
  SUPER smart ...how can we help you get out of this deep poo that you're in?
1. _...an epic story of pressure and expectation unfolds, Jason works with
[the team](/team){: .green } afterwards to create a bang-up plan, SOW for
development of the {{ project }} system is prepared and delivered..._{: .narrator }
1. {{ actor2 }} Awesome, thanks Jason! We'll get back to you ASAP. _Wow, I can't
believe the level of technical detail in this doc -- these ideas on the
Unicorn Rider&trade; integration are fantastic! And this
[executive summary](/executive-summary){: .red } is exactly what {{ actor1 }}{: .no-img }
is gonna want to see!_{: .purple }
      * {{ actor3 }} Holy shiz, Harv! This is really great stuff ...please, please
      can you get {{ actor1 }}{: .no-img } to meet with `{{ site.title }}`??
1. {{ actor1 }} This all sounds great {{ actor2 }}{: .no-img } ...whatever it takes to get
  the {{ project }} done by March. Bring `{{ site.title }}` in and let's
  listen to their ideas some more.
1. _...meet-and-greet and brainstorming sessions follow, {{ site.title }}
charms all involved with their practical can-do and down-to-earth manner. The
proposed UX for the Rainbow Cannon in particular was a big hit..._{: .narrator }
1. {{ actor1 }} I feel confident and I'm signing off on this. Now let's get the
{{ project }} launched, {{ actor2 }}{: .no-img }!
  * {{ actor3 }} _I knew I was right about these guys! Back to doing the 1,000,000
    other things I have to do now..._{: .purple }
1. {{ actor5 }} Hi Harvey, looking forward to working with you! I
  know we just got sign-off from {{ actor1 }}{: .no-img } but I wanted to reach out with...
1. _...A FEW KICKOFF ITEMS!!!_
* **Slack**{: .purple } invites were sent to you and {{ actor3 }}{: .no-img }
-- IM us at any time there. I or one of the developers on the {{ project }}
project will always respond within minutes.
* We also sent you both invites to our internal tracking system...you'll see
that all deliverables in the SOW have already been added there. We use this
system to indicate each item's progress and testing status.
* We like doing weekly **Google Hangouts**{: .blue } or calls with
you to talk through any questions that may come up. Is there a good, regular
time slot for you?
