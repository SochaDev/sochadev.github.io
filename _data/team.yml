    With 20+ years of experience in coding, most of that web-related, Jason is
    proficient in many of the major (and several of the minor) languages and
    standards that make the internet useful. He is a specialist in PHP architecture
    and development and tends to focus on server-side application development. He
    also loves JavaScript, both client and server-side. Jason lives on the business
    side of things mostly these days, but still gets his hands dirty often enough.
    Recent work includes leading development on such larger projects as fcc.gov and
    press.org (The Nat'l Press Club) (both Drupal), among many others.

    Matt lives in Rochester, NY and has been developing for the web for almost 15
    years. He has a B.S. in IT and a M.S. in International Business from D'Youville
    College in Buffalo, NY. While in school Matt was one of 900 students to
    participate in the Google Summer of Code program. He worked with Geeklog CMS
    and developed an installation UI that made the CMS more friendly to install and
    even supported 3rd party plugins and migrations from older versions. In later
    years Matt participated in the Summer of Code program as a student mentor. After
    spending a few years working in the academic world, Matt joined Our Hometown,
    a small web development company that develops and hosts websites for newspapers
    from all over the U.S. Matt led the company's migration of 200 customer sites
    to Drupal.

    As a kid, Drew always loved computers. A hacker at heart, he wrote his first
    computer program at the age of 12 - a simple text-based dungeon crawler, complete
    with random monster encounters and fat loots. His true love for programming,
    however, would not be realized until while attending the University of Missouri
    he was invited to choose a major, or not come back the following semester. He
    had just completed a course in C programming and liked it well enough to make
    programming his profession. Eventually deciding to move to the D.C. area, Drew
    held positions with National Journal, NPR, and Triple Canopy before coming to
    Socha Dev in May of 2013, where he has been wowing everyone with his skills in
    hybrid app development using technologies such as Node.js and Meteor.

    Nate serves as the Development Foreman at Socha Dev, guiding the team and making
    sure functional deliverables are completed according to spec. Nate is a senior
    Drupal developer that has built dozens of sites over the years for a wide
    variety of government, non-profit and private sector clients. These days, Nate
    is becoming increasingly obsessed with all things JavaScript, shell scripting,
    and generally just enhancing the dev machinery at Socha Dev through automation,
    testing and process improvement. When not actively creating great sites for
    clients or cracking his fiery foreman whip (and sometimes in parallel), Nate
    also enjoys tinkering with front-end stack du jour and giving back to the open
    source community however possible.

    Jeff cut his teeth in the ANSI art scene of the BBS heyday before the popularity
    of the internet. He fondly recalls the sound of modems handshaking. He first got
    involved with programming in the BBS modification scene of the late nineties.
    Later he would go on to study software development in college, where he
    developed a love of beautiful software and intuitive interfaces. During college,
    Jeff worked in the dental software industry, supporting UNIX serial networks. In
    2006 he became a systems architect working primarily with internal, home-grown
    web apps for workforce management. In this role, Jeff developed a love for
    JavaScript and CSS, quickly becoming the go-to architect for other developers
    looking to improve their front-end designs and simplify user interactions.

    While majoring in a cross-disciplinary program called Digital Media Design Tory
    picked up a variety of experience in object-oriented programming -- and the
    realization that design was not so much her forte. Maintaining appreciation for
    the visual nonetheless, she soon found her niche in web development via a
    couple of summer internships. After graduating, Tory boarded the Drupal
    bandwagon via her first full-time position and was soon writing custom modules
    and themes alongside honing front-end development skills. Several years later,
    she has many Drupal 6 and 7 websites under her belt for clients such as the
    Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and the American Postal Workers
    Union. Tory is known for getting intimate with the Drupal core APIs and
    writing paragraph-length code comments.
