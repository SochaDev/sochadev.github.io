We're small, but we don't mind &mdash; we're pretty large and mighty when it comes to the business of developing effective and awesome websites and apps.

* * *

## Jason Socha

With 20+ years of experience in coding, most of that web-related, Jason is
proficient in many of the major (and several of the minor) languages and
standards that make the internet useful. He is a specialist in PHP architecture
and development and tends to focus on server-side application development. He
also loves JavaScript, both client and server-side. Jason lives on the business
side of things mostly these days, but still gets his hands dirty often enough.
Recent work includes leading development on such larger projects as fcc.gov and
press.org (The Nat'l Press Club) (both Drupal), among many others.

## Matt West

Matt lives in Rochester, NY and has been developing for the web for almost 15
years. He has a B.S. in IT and a M.S. in International Business from D'Youville
College in Buffalo, NY. While in school Matt was one of 900 students to
participate in the Google Summer of Code program. He worked with Geeklog CMS
and developed an installation UI that made the CMS more friendly to install and
even supported 3rd party plugins and migrations from older versions. In later
years Matt participated in the Summer of Code program as a student mentor. After
spending a few years working in the academic world, Matt joined Our Hometown,
a small web development company that develops and hosts websites for newspapers
from all over the U.S. Matt led the company's migration of 200 customer sites
to Drupal.

## Drew Deering

As a kid, Drew always loved computers. A hacker at heart, he wrote his first
computer program at the age of 12: a simple text-based dungeon crawler, complete
with random monster encounters and fat loots. His true love for programming,
however, would not be realized until while attending the University of Missouri
he was invited to choose a major, or not come back the following semester. He
had just completed a course in C programming and liked it well enough to make
programming his profession. Eventually deciding to move to the D.C. area, Drew
held positions with National Journal, NPR, and Triple Canopy before coming to
Socha Dev in May of 2013, where he has been wowing everyone with his skills in
hybrid app development using technologies such as Node.js and Meteor.

## Nate Mow

Nate serves as the Development Foreman at Socha Dev, guiding the team and making
sure functional deliverables are completed according to spec. Nate is a senior
Drupal developer that has built dozens of sites over the years for a wide
variety of government, non-profit and private sector clients. These days, Nate
is becoming increasingly obsessed with all things JavaScript, shell scripting,
and generally just enhancing the dev machinery at Socha Dev through automation,
testing and process improvement. When not actively creating great sites for
clients or cracking his fiery foreman whip (and sometimes in parallel), Nate
also enjoys tinkering with front-end stack du jour and giving back to the open
source community however possible.

If you think you might be a good fit here at Socha Dev &mdash; please <a href="/#contact" class="green">contact us!</a> If you're a contender we'll probably have a couple of <span class="blue dotted">Google Hangouts</span> together, then maybe invite you to spend a day observing our <span class="purple dotted">Slack</span> activity to get a sense of what the day-to-day here feels like. Pro tip: You should probably include a link to your GitHub account if you're a dev ;)
