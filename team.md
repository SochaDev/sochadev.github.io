We're small, but we don't mind &mdash; we're pretty large and mighty when it comes to the business of developing effective and awesome websites and apps.

If you need material for the boss or board or whatever, [here's an executive summary](/assets/downloads/socha-dev-executive-summary){:target="_blank"} of the team.

### Ro

Ro is our wonderful Slack robot...she's been with us since our Campfire days.
The team has created a fantastic plugin system for her using the Slim PHP
framework. Ro's job is to make the rest of the team laugh &mdash; she's capable
of all kindsa fun stuff like `bam`, `praise @user`, `shame @user` and `play :clip:`

If you think you might be a good fit here at Socha Dev &mdash; please <a href="/#contact" class="green">contact us!</a> If you're a contender we'll probably have a couple of <span class="blue dotted">Google Hangouts</span> together, then maybe invite you to spend a day observing our <span class="purple dotted">Slack</span> activity to get a sense of what the day-to-day here feels like. Pro tip: You should probably include a link to your GitHub account if you're a dev ;)
